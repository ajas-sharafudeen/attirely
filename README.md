🌟 Introducing you to Attirely App Project🛍️

I've been working on a full-stack shopping application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) that's designed to make online shopping smooth and simple. Whether you're browsing through products or checking out, the entire experience is seamless and intuitive.

Here's what makes it special:

🔒 Secure login and registration using JWT

🛒 Effortless shopping cart that updates in real time

🔍 Smart product search and filtering to find exactly what you're looking for

💳 Easy checkout and payment integration with Paypal for a hassle-free experience

📱 Responsive design for both desktop and mobile

A special shoutout to my mentor, Mr. Sangam, for his continuous guidance and support throughout this journey. This project pushed me to refine my skills in both front-end and back-end development, and it's been an incredible learning experience.
